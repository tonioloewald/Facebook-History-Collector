Facebook History Collector
==========================

a.k.a. _Facehugger_

This Safari browser extension was developed for the [Online Social Influence Lab](http://osil.psy.ua.edu).

It essentially drills down through older posts until a specific string is matched (by
default this is "March") and then locates all threads in a specified date range, expands
the threads, and then converts them into summary form ready for data analysis.
